remapping.py - Attachment Point Remapping

When collapsing stem segments (e.g., 10 links → 3 links), child branches
attached to the stem need their attachment points recalculated to preserve
their absolute height in the world.

Mathematical model (p=1.0, top-of-link convention):
    H_abs = attach_link / N_old          (fraction of total height)
    V     = H_abs * N_new
    k_new = floor(V) + 1  if H<1.0,  else N_new   (1-based, edge-case guarded)
    p_new = V - floor(V)               (fraction within new link)
