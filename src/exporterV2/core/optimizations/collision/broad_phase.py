broad_phase.py - Two-Stage Broad-Phase Collision Detection

Orchestrates the two-stage collision detection pipeline:
    Stage 1: Sphere overlap (fast pre-check)
    Stage 2: AABB overlap (precision check)

This hybrid approach balances performance and accuracy:
- Sphere check is O(1) and very fast
- AABB check is also O(1) but slightly more expensive
- Most cases are rejected by sphere check, avoiding AABB computation

Usage:
    from collision.broad_phase import check_attachment_collision
    
    result = check_attachment_collision(new_link, siblings, parent, margin=0.01)
    if result.collision_detected:
        print(f"Collision with: {result.colliding_with}")

    Two-stage broad-phase collision check for attachment validation.
    
    Checks if a new link (being attached after remapping) collides with:
    - Sibling links (other branches at same/adjacent parent ranks)
    - Parent link (optional, usually not needed for attachment)

    Algorithm:
        Stage 1 (Sphere Pre-check):
            - Calculate bounding spheres for all objects
            - Check new_link sphere against each sibling/parent sphere
            - If no overlap → return "no collision"
            - If overlap → collect candidates for Stage 2
        
        Stage 2 (AABB Precision):
            - For each candidate from Stage 1:
                - Calculate AABBs
                - Check AABB overlap
                - If overlap → collision detected
