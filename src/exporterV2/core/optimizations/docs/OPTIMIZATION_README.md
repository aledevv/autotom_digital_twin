## 📋 Executive Summary

### Problem
Isaac Sim/PhysX has a hardware-imposed limit of ~250 joints per articulation. Day 100+ tomato plants with multiple branches, trusses, and fruits exceed this limit, causing physics solver instability or engine crashes.

### Solution
An incremental optimization system that applies 5 LOD-based techniques ordered by minimal visual impact, reducing joints until fitting within the budget while maintaining structural integrity.

### Techniques (Priority Order)
1. **Petiole Lock** (Priority 1): D6 → Fixed joint (no geometry change)
2. **Lateral Reduce** (Priority 2): Reduce segments in lateral branches
3. **Stem Collapse** (Priority 3): Collapse trunk segments + remap attachments
4. **Truss Static** (Priority 4): Pre-bent static geometry
5. **Leaf Branch Reduce** (Priority 5): Merge petiole + rachis

### Key Features
- ✅ **Incremental**: Applies techniques progressively, stopping immediately when budget is met
- ✅ **Safe**: Geometric validation + collision checks after each step
- ✅ **Transparent**: Detailed report with breakdown per technique
- ✅ **Configurable**: External YAML for budget, limits, parameters
- ✅ **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for new techniques

### Validation
- **Research-backed**: Approach validated by LOD/MOR literature (see `Research_Joint-Budget Optimization for USD Tomato Plant Exporter Approach Validation and SOTA Review.md`)
- **Industry standard**: Two-stage broad-phase collision detection (Sphere + AABB)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers & Researchers

1. **Read** [Comprehensive Report](./notion_pages/7_Comprehensive_Optimization_Report.md) for technical details and algorithms.
2. **Consult** [Research Validation](./RESEARCH_VALIDATION.md) and [Exporter V2 Implementation Notes](../../../docs/07_implementation_notes.md) for background and current engineering decisions.
3. **Use** [Quick Start](./OPTIMIZATION_QUICK_START.md) for quick references on running tests and configuring the environment.

### For Users

```python
# Basic Example
from exporterV2.core.optimizations import BudgetOptimizer

optimizer = BudgetOptimizer()
optimized_branches, report = optimizer.optimize(branches)
print(report)
```

```bash
# From CLI
./run_mainV2.sh --day 50 --optimize
```

See [Quick Start](./OPTIMIZATION_QUICK_START.md) for full examples.
