lateral_reduce.py - Lateral Branch Reduction Optimization Technique

Reduces the number of segments (n_links) in lateral branches incrementally.
This technique collapses segments and remaps child attachment points (leaves, etc.)
using geometry remapping from Task 3.

Rationale:
- Lateral branches contribute significantly to joint count in mature plants
- Reducing segments from 3→2→1 maintains structural integrity with less articulation
- Child branches (leaves) are remapped to preserve geometric positioning

Priority Strategy:
- Reduce smallest branches first (by radius) - least significant for plant mechanics
- In case of tie (same radius), reduce lower branches first (by attach_link)
- In case of tie (same attach + radius), alphabetically by ID

Usage:
    technique = LateralBranchReductionTechnique()
    if technique.can_apply(branches):
        reduction = technique.estimate_reduction(branches)
        modified, report = technique.apply(branches)
